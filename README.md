# TempleOS ISOs
Due to the [TempleOS Site](https://templeos.org) being located somewhere in the US, it makes downloading from somewhere else (Such as Australia for me personally) to be slow. Thankfully GitHub has mutliple nodes which it can chose from. Hopefully these downloads will be faster. 

This repo is essentially all of the ISOs found on the official site. You'll find an additional file here called `temple` which is a preinstalled `qcow2` file for QEMU.
